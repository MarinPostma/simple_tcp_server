# Simple TCP chat server

## Intro

This is a simple TCP chat server written in rust for a school project. It is meant to be used with this [client](https://github.com/MarinPostma/simple_tcp_chat_client).

## Building

simply run `cargo run` in the project directory. As with the client it is very ressource demanding and very very unoptimized.
